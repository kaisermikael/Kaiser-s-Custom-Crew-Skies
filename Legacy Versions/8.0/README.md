-INTRODUCING: THE PACK MERGER
(TL;DR- Speedy's pack is now merged with the Crew pack. Rename armor/ elytra in anvil for special versions.)
For the past several versions, the only difference between Speedy's pack and the main Crew pack has been his mullet elytra. Side's pack has a number of other additions because Kaiser is a simp- I mean. "Big fan" of Side, and thus has his own pack as well with unique weebish-things. HOWEVER- this update introduces a way to add Speedy's mullet-elytra to ALL packs without making it the default texture. Likewise, now Side's custom Ironnman Netherite armor can also be seen!

-FOR SPEEDY'S ELYTRA:
All you have to do is rename your elytra in an Anvil to EXACTLY this: 

Mud Flaps

It must be spelt EXACTLY like that- Capitalized letters, the space, everything. If you do this, then any elytra with the name "Mud Flaps" will be the Mullet Elytra.

-FOR SIDE'S IRON MAN ARMOR:
All you have to do is rename your netherite armor (each piece respectively) in an Anvil EXACTLY as:

Ironman Helmet
Ironman Chestplate
Ironman Leggings
Ironman Boots
